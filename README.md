## General Information
- What is the business probem that your project is trying to solve?
Build a Linear Regression Model out of given dataset for Predicting demand of Shared Bikes which can be used byt he company post covi to improve the business.
- What is the dataset that is being used?
Given by Upgrad

## Conclusions
- Notable relationship between the count and both the temperature and feeling temperature
- R-square for the manually built model is 0.81
- Equation of our best fitted line is:
count = 0.32 + 0.36*temp - 0.15*spring - 0.157*windspeed - 0.27*lightrain_lightsnow_thunderrtorm - 0.075*mist_cloudy + 0.23*yr

## Technologies Used
numpy, dataframe, matplotlib, seaborn, pandas, sykitlearn, statsmodel
